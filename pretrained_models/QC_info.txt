QC on pretrained models were run using the images in the folder "Pretrained Model QC Images". Images were pulled from CEM-Mitolab (EMPIAR-11037), none of which were used to train the pretrained model "mitochondria-mitolab". Noise was superficially removed with BM3D at a standard deviation of 10 (except clean_8.tiff, which was denoised with a stdev of 30). To generate the noisy images, gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 25 was added to the images in the notebook.
