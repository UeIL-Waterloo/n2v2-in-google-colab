# The barebones training code used for the pretrained models, which were trained using Compute Canada's servers. Either Cedar or Graham will work.

# run training by importing both n2v2_job_script.sh and n2v2_training.py to the project directory, then run the following:
# cd $project
# sbatch n2v2_job_script.sh

##Import key dependencies:
import tensorflow

##Ignore warnings

#replace fields with the names of your folders

## Load data/training parameters:

#note that N2V2 only supports 2D, single-frame image files
