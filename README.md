# n2v2-in-google-colab
Noise2Void (N2V) is a deep-learning technique used to denoise images, developed by Krull et. al. in 2019. It is unique from other deep-learning techniques in that it is self-supervised, so sets of high- and low- noise images are not required for training. As such, it lends itself well to use for microscopy images, where multiple high signal-to-noise ratio images are not often feasible.

This particular notebook uses an improved version of N2V, N2V2, developed in 2022. This version eliminates the checkerboard artifacts that often result from N2V, as shown below:

## Pretrained Models:

This notebook supports both training your own model and predicting denoised images. If you do not have the data to train a model, you can still use this notebook! I have included some preloaded models trained on specific subjects. You can peruse the selection in the "pretrained models" directory above, and they will be made available to you when you load the notebook. To use one, please follow the instructions in the notebook :) 

**Tip:** Models work best on similar-looking data. It may work better to use a model that was trained on images that look like your images, even if the subjects are different. Likewise, you can expect your models to have better performance if your training images are similar to the images you want to denoise.
